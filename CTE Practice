Let's say you work as a data analyst for your city, and your boss wants a list of all the bike lanes that have an average safety rating of 4.0 or higher. She also wants to see the average safety rating for each of those bike lanes, and a label that says "Safe Lane".
WITH Bike_CTE AS (
SELECT street, AVG(safetyrating) as 'rating'
FROM CityBikeLanes
GROUP BY street)

SELECT street, rating, 'Safe Lane' as 'Label'
FROM Bike_CTE
WHERE rating >= 4.0;

a list of all the bike lanes, both safety ratings for each lane, the average safety rating for each lane, and a label with the recommendation as "Remove", "Leave As-Is", or "Improvements Needed"
SELECT street, safetyrating,
AVG(safetyrating) OVER (PARTITION BY street) as "Average_safety_rating",
CASE
WHEN AVG(safetyrating) OVER (PARTITION BY street) >= 4 THEN 'Leave as-is'
WHEN AVG(safetyrating) OVER (PARTITION BY street) < 2.5 THEN 'Remove'
ELSE 'Improvements Needed'
END as Recommendation
FROM CityBikeLanes
