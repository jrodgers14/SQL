#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data.


#1 How many orders were placed in January?
SELECT COUNT(orderID) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales 
WHERE orderID <> 'Order ID'
AND length(orderID) = 6;

#2 How many of those orders were for an iPhone?
SELECT Count(orderID) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product = 'iPhone'
AND orderID <> 'Order ID'
AND length(orderID) = 6;

#3 Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
SELECT customers.acctnum FROM BIT_DB.customers
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales
ON customers.order_id = FebSales.orderID
WHERE febsales.orderID <> 'Order ID'
AND length(orderID) = 6;

#4 Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
SELECT distinct Product, Price FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Price in (SELECT MIN(Price) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales);

#5 What is the total revenue for each product sold in January? (Revenue can be calculated using the number of products sold and the price of the products).
SELECT Product, SUM(Quantity)*Price AS Revenue FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY Product;

#6 Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT Product, SUM(Quantity) AS Quantity, SUM(Quantity)*Price AS Revenue FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY Product;

#7 How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT cust.acctnum), AVG(Quantity*Price) AS Avg_Revenue FROM BIT_DB.customers cust
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
ON cust.order_id = Feb.orderID
WHERE Feb.orderID <> 'Order ID'
AND length(orderID) = 6
AND Feb.Quantity > 2;

#8 List all the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many of each were sold.
SELECT Product, sum(quantity) 
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location like '%Los Angeles%'
